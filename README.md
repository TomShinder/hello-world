# hello-world
This is the first repository created by Thomas W. Shinder, M.D. - I'll put some stuff in here when I figure out how this works
I like to do many things - Azure security is a favorite topic of mine. I also like statistics and data science, and of course, all this comes together with my hobby, horse racing :)
